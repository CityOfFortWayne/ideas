Brainstorming for the CityOfFortWayne GitHub repository
=====

See [flu-shot-spec](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/flu-shot-spec/blob/master/city-of-philadelphia/locations.geojson) and the [CityOfPhiladelphia](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia) GitHub organization for examples of what this could become.

Ideas
-----

- A repo for each of the sets of data on [jgdata.net](http://www.jgdata.net/)
- Work with Journal Gazette to provide a JSON API for the data on [jgdata.net](http://www.jgdata.net/)
- A repo for flu shot locations across the city of Fort Wayne. See [flu-shot-spec](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/flu-shot-spec/blob/master/city-of-philadelphia/locations.geojson) for a great example of the utility of this data set to the public.

Disclaimer
----------

This is an UNOFFICIAL GitHub organization for the city of Fort Wayne. If you work for Fort Wayne, please contact [hopper.derek@gmail.com](mailto:hopper.derek@gmail.com] to arrange for transfer of ownership.

The repositories in the CityOfFortWayne GitHub organization are an attempt to provide great data sets to the public via modern RESTful APIs and to encourage the city to provide public APIs of all its data. The benefit of public APIs to city data far outweighs any negative effect.
