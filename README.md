# City of Fort Wayne

## Brainstorming

See [flu-shot-spec](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/flu-shot-spec/blob/master/city-of-philadelphia/locations.geojson) and the [CityOfPhiladelphia](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia) GitHub organization for examples of what this could become.

## Ideas

- A repository for each of the sets of data on [jgdata.net](http://www.jgdata.net/)
- Work with Journal Gazette to provide a JSON API for the data on [jgdata.net](http://www.jgdata.net/)
- A repository for flu shot locations across the city of Fort Wayne. See [flu-shot-spec](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/flu-shot-spec/blob/master/city-of-philadelphia/locations.geojson) for a great example of the utility of this data set to the public.
- A repository of traffic cams, weather cams, etc. Also, an API for these cams i.e. I have a street address and I want to see the cams in the area of that address.
- An API for the public library.

> The emergence of GPS as an everyday tool for people is an everyday example of the economic potential locked up in government data. As Park said when he first accepted his role as US CTO, “There are a bunch of [kickbutt] innovators out there. Our job as leaders is to find those innovators and release their mojo.” He routinely hosts Data Jams and Datapaloozas, competitive events that encourage the development of viable business ideas and offer funding to help winning ideas come to life.

## Disclaimer

This is an UNOFFICIAL GitHub organization for the city of Fort Wayne. If you work for Fort Wayne, please contact [hopper.derek@gmail.com](mailto:hopper.derek@gmail.com) to arrange for transfer of ownership.

The repositories in the CityOfFortWayne GitHub organization are an attempt to provide great data sets to the public via modern RESTful APIs and to encourage the city to provide public APIs of all its data. The benefit of public APIs to city data far outweighs any negative effect.
